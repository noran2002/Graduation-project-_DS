## 📁 Project Structure

- **Notebook 1**:  
  👉 Recommends meals based on the user's health condition and available nutritional needs.  
  📊 Uses **KMeans Clustering** to group similar food items and suggest personalized options.  
  📂 Works with a specific dataset for food items.

- **Notebook 2**:  
  👉 Predicts suitable heart rate range based on user-specific health factors (e.g., age, weight, condition).  
  🤖 Uses **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** for classification and prediction.  
  📂 Uses a separate dataset related to health and heart rate.

## 🧠 Features

- 🍽️ **Health-Aware Meal Recommendations**: Clusters food items based on nutritional similarity and suggests appropriate meals.
- ❤️ **Heart Rate Prediction**: Uses SVM to predict recommended heart rate ranges according to user input.
- 🔄 Each notebook is modular and based on its own dataset for clarity and organization.
