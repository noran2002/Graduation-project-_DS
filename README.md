# 🥗 Health Food & Calorie Recommendation System

This project consists of two machine learning-based recommendation systems that help users make better food choices and estimate suitable calorie intake based on their health profile.

---

## 📁 Files

- `food_recommender.ipynb`  
  👉 Recommends meals based on user’s health condition and available calorie intake.  
  📊 Uses **KMeans Clustering** to group food items and suggest the most relevant ones.  
  📂 Dataset: `food_data.csv`

- `calorie_predictor.ipynb`  
  👉 Estimates the recommended daily calories for a person based on features like age, weight, and health status.  
  🤖 Uses **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** for classification.  
  📂 Dataset: `calorie_data.csv`

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, SVM)

## 🧠 Features

- 🔍 **Health-Aware Meal Recommendations**: Suggests meals based on clustering similar nutritional profiles and user health conditions.
- 🧮 **Personalized Calorie Prediction**: Uses machine learning to estimate how many calories a user should consume.
- 📂 Each notebook works with its own dataset to ensure modularity and clarity.
